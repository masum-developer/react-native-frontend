        Class 2: Overview of React Native vs. Other Mobile Development
        Frameworks
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h4">React Natives Distinctive Advantages</Typography>
      <Typography align="justify" mt={2}>
        1. Better UI Development: React Native stands out for its superior UI
        development capabilities. Its declarative programming style simplifies
        the creation of responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. This
        approach ensures that UIs look great on various devices, enhancing the
        overall user experience.
      </Typography>
      <Typography align="justify" mt={2}>
        2. Code Reusability: React Native enables significant code reuse across
        different platforms. By utilizing JavaScript, which is compatible with
        both iOS and Android, developers can write a single codebase and deploy
        it across multiple platforms. This reduces development time, maintenance
        effort, and ensures consistency across platforms.
      </Typography>
      <Typography align="justify" mt={2}>
        3. Performance: Despite its crossplatform nature, React Native maintains
        high performance levels. Its architecture allows for native code
        execution, optimizing performance while leveraging the flexibility of
        JavaScript.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h4" mt={2}>
        Why Choose React Native?
      </Typography>
      <Typography align="justify" mt={2}>
        Efficiency: React Natives code reusability minimizes duplication of
        efforts, leading to faster development cycles and reduced timetomarket.
      </Typography>
      <Typography align="justify" mt={2}>
        CostEffectiveness: By streamlining development and maintenance
        processes, React Native helps businesses save costs associated with
        mobile app development.
