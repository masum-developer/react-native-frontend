JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages, dynamic user interfaces, web and mobile applications, and many other types of software.JavaScript is a powerful language that supports many programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and procedural programming. It is also the primary language used for creating browser extensions and add-ons, and is increasingly used in other areas.JavaScript code is executed by a JavaScript engine, which is built into modern web browsers.
